In the first iteration, we established the server and implemented both frontend and backend functionalities to enable the creation of workout routines, encompassing exercise details, sets, and repetitions, and subsequently storing this data in the database. During this phase, our primary focus was on acquainting ourselves with React Native, and we prioritized achieving a functional version of our application over fine-tuning the user interface. One notable challenge we encountered was the limited number of meetings before the deadline, which impacted our productivity. In the upcoming iteration, we aim to enhance our collaboration by increasing the frequency of our meetings throughout the week. Our goals for the next phase include the creation of individual user profiles within the database, facilitating user interactions, and improving the overall user experience through the use of Figma for UI design.

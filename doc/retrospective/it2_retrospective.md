### User Stories delivered
- As a gym-goer I want to be able to find/be matched with another gym-goer (based on criteria such as location, fitness goals, and interests) so I can have a gym buddy.
- As a user, I want to send connection requests.
- Algorithm to find similarity score between two users

### User Stories not delivered
We were unable to complete accepting/declining connection requests for the previous iteration and we will finish it this iteration.
For the next iteration, we want to focus on the following user stories:
- As a user, I want to have a way to provide feedback, report issues, or seek help from the app's support team.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how my progress (via leaderboard for example) stacks up against my peers (who are comparable based on sex,weight,age,etc.) so the competitive aspect pushes me.
- As a gym-goer, I want to be able to post my progress, workout results, and fitness achievements so that others can see it.

### Challenges we had
We did most of the work a couple days before the deadline and we should have spread out the work more across the week. 

### How we will do better
We will try to meet more times throughout the week and have more productive meetings. The app is pretty slow sometimes, so we will focus on making the user experience better.

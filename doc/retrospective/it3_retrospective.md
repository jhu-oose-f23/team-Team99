In iteration 3, we fixed several bugs and added a leaderboard which shows which users can move the most weights per workout.
We focused more on bugfixes and enhancements rather than user stores, which was perhaps not the best idea since building a minimum viable product
as quickly as possible should be our priority.

Moving forward, we'll try to meet outside of class time as well and start working on the iteration earlier (>1 week before the iteration deadline).
